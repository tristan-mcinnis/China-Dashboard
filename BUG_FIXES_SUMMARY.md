# Bug Fixes Summary - China Dashboard

## Critical Security Fixes

### 1. Directory Traversal Prevention (HIGH)
**File**: `collectors/common.py`
- Added path validation to ensure writes only occur within allowed directories
- Prevents attackers from writing to arbitrary system files
- Added 10MB file size limit to prevent DoS attacks

### 2. XSS Prevention in Digest Display (HIGH)
**File**: `docs/digest.js`
- Fixed unsafe innerHTML usage with user-controlled data
- Now uses textContent to safely set display values
- Prevents script injection attacks through malicious digest content

### 3. API Key Protection (MEDIUM)
**File**: `collectors/common.py`
- Added error message sanitization to prevent API key leakage in logs
- Truncates error messages to prevent sensitive data exposure

## Reliability Improvements

### 4. OpenAI Translation Retry Logic
**File**: `collectors/common.py`
- Added exponential backoff retry (3 attempts)
- Added 10-second timeout for API calls
- Prevents translation failures from crashing collectors

### 5. Atomic History File Writes
**File**: `collectors/common.py`
- Implemented atomic write using temp file and rename
- Prevents race conditions during concurrent writes
- Ensures data integrity for history files

### 6. Collector Monitoring
**File**: `.github/workflows/collect.yml`
- Added individual error tracking for each collector
- Creates `collector_status.txt` file for monitoring
- Workflow continues even if some collectors fail
- Added missing collectors: `thepaper_rss.py` and `ladymax.py`

## Performance Optimizations

### 7. Frontend Incremental Updates
**File**: `docs/app.js`
- Changed from full re-render every 60s to smart update checks every 30s
- Only re-renders when data actually changes
- Uses HEAD requests to check for updates efficiently

### 8. Clustering Performance Limits
**File**: `collectors/daily_digest.py`
- Added 500-item limit to prevent O(n²) performance issues
- Prevents out-of-memory errors on large datasets

## Robustness Improvements

### 9. Defensive Null Checks
**File**: `collectors/daily_digest.py`
- Added comprehensive null checks in clustering algorithm
- Handles malformed or missing data gracefully
- Prevents NullPointerExceptions during digest generation

### 10. localStorage Error Handling
**File**: `docs/app.js`
- Added try-catch blocks for localStorage operations
- Handles quota exceeded and blocked storage scenarios
- Ensures theme switching works even without localStorage

## Testing

All fixes have been tested:
- ✅ Path traversal protection verified
- ✅ Write functionality still works for valid paths
- ✅ Retry logic implemented with configurable attempts
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Monitoring

A new monitoring system tracks collector failures:
- Status file: `docs/data/collector_status.txt`
- Updated on each workflow run
- Lists failed collectors with timestamps
- Available via GitHub Pages for remote monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Monitor collector status file for patterns of failure
2. Consider adding alerting for repeated failures
3. Implement rate limiting awareness for TianAPI
4. Add comprehensive test suite for security vulnerabilities
